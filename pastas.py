'Hey guys, I’m new to overwatch. Is there a reason that they aren’t using any damage heroes? How are they supposed to get kills without dps? Are they deleted or banned or something?',

#innit
"Do british people actually exist? I mean, they must be a meme, there is a not a single thing about them. And I mean it. Let's go through the evidence: Where are they from? Not a single country in the world is named Britain. Some people say they come from England, and England is inside Britain, but if that was the case they would be British they would be Englanders. Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people do not exist. Whales live in the sea. There is a consensus on british people coming from Europe, but then we are left with a whole continent of possible locations. That's as good as nothing. What do they eat? Every country has at least one main dish. Even the US has their burgers. But these british people, what do they eat? Heard some people associating them with tea, but everyone knows that's an Asian thing. Shouldn't they come from Europe? One of these two points must be wrong them. To me, it looks too sketchy. What language do they speak? I challenge you, putting all my money and my ass on the line here, to find a supposed british person speaking their native language. Most of then just speak a broken ENGLISH. Yes, english. Really suspicious, huh? And I even tried to look deeper into it. Maybe british just SOUND like english, just like spanish could sound like portuguese for a non-speaker. So I looked up british dictionary on google and what I found was shocking: every word in there was AMERICAN. I kid you not. What this could mean is beyond my capabilities, but I can safely assure you that british people do not exist.",

#simp
"What the fuck man. I'm literally sitting here on the verge of tears. Slaving away in this dead end job saving up for the end of the month splash. I was this close. Maybe I should have done that overtime, if I could get her that money earlier I might have been able to convince her in the dono message. She needs a man that can treat her right, a man like me. I would open the car door for her EVERY TIME, I would pull out her chair at a restaurant, I would lay my twitch hoodie over puddles to protect her from the filth.",

#pee, piss
"Pee is currently dripping down my leg, it is warm. :)",

#furry
"I'm not a furry, I swear! I just really, really like anthropomorphic animals and the artistic potential you can get out of them. I mean, sure I drew what is essentially an anthropomorphic bunny as a new OC as of recent, but doesn't mean I'm a furry! Sure, I love looking at other people's art and it may steadily be becoming a part of my visual aesthetic, but I'll tell you yet again: I AM NOT A FURRY. I never will be, I would feel great shame if I were a furry.",

#kephrii
"I made $20,000 last month. I don't care for your reactions. Don't value your attention so highly. I truly don't care. This is my amusement merely while I eat.",

#flashy
"Idk which ow T2 editor needs to hear this but flashy fast cuts ≠ good editing. All of u sad Abt not being picked for may melee I've seen your cuts and there's a reason the ones picked, were picked over yours. Egoing won't make you better at your craft.",

#ninja
"I’m in the middle of carrying a League Of Legends game about to close out, and my braless wife brings me a sandwich (not asked for) with chips as I get a double kill bot lane. So how is your day going?",

#overedit
"Alright my guy a word of advice. The editing is really well done but wayyyyy too much. You can still make things look cool without extreme effects because being honest i couldnt really see what happened most of the time. If you want a really good expressive way to edit some vids id suggest looking how andrewjrt does his indepth overwatch vids. He has some crazy great edits that arent over baring. But all in all great job im pretty sure youll be great at editing and making vids! But remember to tone it down a bit at some points. Find the perfect groove for you.",

#kys
"./data/WO5ogmyN8Vi11Hh_.mp4",

#zoom
"why is it zoomed in? because its an artistic choice, it looks very nice zoomed in and maybe you should zoomed in even more (perhaps 8x scale) and its not a mediocre edit with intense flicker all the way to the end with one framers and shake spams everywhere making you think that this is perhaps not a subject related video editing but just purely transition wrapped crafted and built with some random footage in the background and inbetween to make the transition looks very nice to watch (and edgy)",
